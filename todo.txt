[for others]
- write nix flake
- write readme with configuration necessary in WM etc.
- make it possible to externalize ui
- make it scriptable (e.g. with lua)

[for me]
- add "apps" like calculator/translator
- maybe make highlighed entry sexier
- some clipping at the bottom; bottom border is not visible
